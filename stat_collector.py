    Accuracy and cost cannot be calculated with the full test dataset
    in one pass, so they must be computed in batches. Unfortunately,
    the built-in TF summary nodes cannot be told to aggregate multiple
    executions. Therefore, we aggregate the accuracy/cost ourselves at
    the python level, and push it through the accuracy/cost summary
    nodes to generate the appropriate summary protobufs for writing.
